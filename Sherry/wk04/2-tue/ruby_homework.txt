Alphabetize the contents of heroes using a method. The Ruby documentation might help.

# Answer: puts heroes.sort

Randomize the contents of heroes using a method. The Ruby documentation might help.

# Answer: puts heroes.shuffle 

Bonus

Select a random element from heroes using a method. The Ruby documentation might help.

		  puts rand_heroes

Select all elements in heroes that begin with "B" using a method. The Ruby documentation might help.

# Answer:
def include?(elem)
	if elem.begin_with?('B')
		return true
	else
		return false
	end
end
heroes.select { |elem| heroes.include?('B')}

Initialize a hash called ninja_turtle with the properties name, weapon and radical. They should have values of "Michelangelo", "Nunchuks" and true respectively.

# Answer: 
ninja_turtle = {
	name: 'Michelangelo',
	weapon: 'Nunchuks',
	radical: true
}
Add a key age to ninja_turtle. Set it to whatever numerical value you'd like.

# Answer: ninja_turtle[:age] = '31'
          puts ninja_turtle

Remove the radical key-value pair from ninja_turtle.

# Answer: ninja_turtle.delete(:radical)
          puts ninja_turtle

Add a key pizza_toppings to ninja_turtle. Set it to an array of strings (e.g., ["cheese", "pepperoni", "peppers"]).

# Answer: ninja_turtle[:pizza_toppings] = ["cheese", "pepperoni", "peppers"]
          puts ninja_turtle

Access the first element of pizza_toppings.

# Answer: puts ninja_turtle[:pizza_toppings][0]

Produce an array containing all of ninja_turtle's keys using a method. The Ruby documentation might help.

# Answer: array = ninja_turtle.keys 
          puts array


Bonus

Print out each key-value pair in the following format - "KEY's is equal to VALUE" -- using a method. The Ruby documentation might help.

# Answer:
ninja_turtle.each {|key, value|}
	puts "#{key} is equal to #{value}"
